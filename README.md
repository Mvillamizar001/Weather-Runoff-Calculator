As a Civil Engineer and an MIS professional, I am developing a web application that integrates weather data with hydrological calculations to estimate surface runoff using precipitation levels and the Curve Number (CN) method. This app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data, including precipitation, temperature, and humidity. Users can input their location and CN values to calculate runoff, which is crucial for flood risk assessment, stormwater management, and infrastructure planning. The application is built using Flask, incorporating interactive maps (Leaflet.js) and data visualization (Chart.js) to enhance user experience and provide actionable insights for engineers and urban planners.
